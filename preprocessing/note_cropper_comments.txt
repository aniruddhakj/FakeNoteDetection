Cases for which it does not work:

1) Super high resolution images. Try to keep resolution below 2048x2048
2) Images where note is pretty close to the edge. The entire border of the image will 
be considered as the contour (padding the image will probably solve this).
3) Too many distinct objects around the note.
4) Note is a very small part of the image.

If dilation is not performed, we will get tons of segments within the note and the 
note as a whole will not be segmented.
Using higher size of structuring element like 7x7 helps to reduce distance between 
any gaps in the edges and helps us segment the entire note.
Too high a size will segment other background objects along with the note.
